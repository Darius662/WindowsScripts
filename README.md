## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WindowsScripts.git

- ‚úÖ Use `SecureString` for password parameters
- ‚úÖ Require Administrator privileges where needed
- ‚úÖ Include comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Provide detailed logging capabilities
- ‚úÖ Validate input parameters and file paths

## Usage Examples

### Export and Import Users
```powershell
# On source computer
.\UsersAndGroupsScripts\Export-UsersAndGroups.ps1 -OutputPath "C:\Migration\users.csv"

# On target computer
$SecurePass = ConvertTo-SecureString "TempPass123!" -AsPlainText -Force
.\UsersAndGroupsScripts\Import-UsersAndGroups.ps1 -InputPath "C:\Migration\users.csv" -DefaultPassword $SecurePass
```

### Export, Import, and Remove Folder Permissions
```powershell
# Export permissions
.\FolderPermissionScripts\Export-FolderPermissions.ps1 -FolderPath "C:\SharedData" -OutputPath "permissions.csv"

# Import permissions
.\FolderPermissionScripts\Import-FolderPermissions.ps1 -CsvFile "permissions.csv" -TargetBasePath "D:\SharedData"

# Remove all non-inherited permissions
.\FolderPermissionScripts\Remove-FolderPermissions.ps1 -FolderPath "D:\SharedData" -Recursive -WhatIf
```

### Export and Import Shared Folders
```powershell
# Export shared folders

```

### Export and Import Scheduled Tasks
```powershell

.\TaskSchedulerScripts\Export-ScheduledTasks.ps1 -OutputPath "C:\Migration\tasks.csv"

# Import scheduled tasks
$SecurePass = ConvertTo-SecureString "TaskPassword123!" -AsPlainText -Force
.\TaskSchedulerScripts\Import-ScheduledTasks.ps1 -InputPath "C:\Migration\tasks.csv" -TaskPassword $SecurePass
```
